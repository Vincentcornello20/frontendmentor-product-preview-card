## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive images using the `<picture>` element
- Google Fonts: Montserrat & Fraunces


### What I learned

During this project, I focused on making the card layout responsive using media queries. I practiced how to switch the layout from horizontal on desktop screens to vertical on mobile screens. This taught me how to target different screen sizes and adjust styles such as flex direction, widths, padding, and border-radius accordingly.

I also implemented responsive images using the `<picture>` element, which allowed me to serve different images for mobile and desktop without extra CSS.


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my understanding of:

- Responsive design techniques for complex layouts
- Advanced flexbox and grid usage
- Organizing CSS in a scalable way for larger projects
- Accessibility and interactive element styling
